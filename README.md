Android Client
==============

It's a SIP softphone based on CSipSimple created with the intention of automating the configuration 
of a ng-voice account.

It consists of a series of classes which are capable of connecting via HTTPS to a REST API using a one-time login 
to fetch every account and information needed to create a local SIP account on the softphone.

This project is a work in progress.
